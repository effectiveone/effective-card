## What is in this repository

The plugin contains three cards that work for the hover effect. Cards can be modified by changing appropriate criteria in block-editor (formerly gutenberg).

## How it works?

To be able to use the plug-in, please follow the instructions
- Download the pluggin as a zip from the repository
- Enter the administration panel on your wordpress website.
- In the pluggins tab, select> Add pluggin.
- Press the "Add pluggin" button and then move the zip along with the pluggin to "select file"
- After adding the plugin, go to the pluggins> installed pluggins tab and activate the pluggin.
- You can only use pluggin in the gutenberg wizard. And on the subpages created in this creator.
